    <h1>Mateo Uno Dulay || October 17,2025 || First Non Graded Activity</h1>

    <h1>Simple Selectors (h1)</h1>

    <h2>Subheading 1 :)</h2>
    
    <p class="highlight">
        This paragraph has the atribute class="highlight"!Hello !
    </p>
    
    <p class="highlight">
        This is another Paragraph with attribute class="highlight"!  Hallo !
    </p>
    
    <h2>Subheading 2 :3</h2>
    <p>
        This paragraph has the same style as our main header (header 1) !
    </p>
    
    <div>
        This is a div line with a span line inside it. (div is a block element, meaning it groups elements inside together. However, I included a breakline function to separate this text from the next line.) 
        <br>
        <span id="mainPoint">
            This is a span line. It is unlike a paragraph, where it can output words without starting a new line. (This speciffic span line has an id attribute named "mainPoint".)
        </span>
